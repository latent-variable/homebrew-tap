## Agent context (scope + memory)
<!-- BEGIN agent-context (managed by ~/.agents/bin/project-sync.sh) -->
- You are in **PROJECT scope** (this repo). Everything that is true across projects lives in user-scope canon (`~/.agents/AGENTS.md` + skills) and is NOT repeated here; this file holds only what is true of THIS repo.
- Project memory + shared skills: `.agents/` (gitignored). Read `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` first.
- `.claude`/`.agents` here may be symlinks; verify with `readlink` before claiming a write landed.
- This file holds project facts only. Check with `~/.agents/bin/canon-echo.sh .`; a real exception is marked `<!-- canon-override: <rule> — <why> (date) -->`.
- Refresh infra: `~/.agents/bin/project-sync.sh .`
<!-- END agent-context -->
