  caveats <<~EOS
    On first run, grant Accessibility (to dictate / read selected text) and
    Microphone (for dictation), or use Clipboard mode for reading (no
    permission needed). First launch downloads the Kokoro voice model
    (~340 MB). Everything runs locally — no cloud, no account, no tracking.
